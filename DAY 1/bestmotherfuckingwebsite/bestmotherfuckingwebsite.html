			<p>For real.</p>
	</header>

	<section>
		<h2>Styling?</h2>
			<p>You probably build websites using vim and you think that's hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span> is going to get you some award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.</p>
			<p>Well, guess what, you're WRONG, motherfucker.</p>

			
		<h2>The best kick-ass website</h2>
			<p>Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
				<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the Google home page</li>
				<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your 16x32 Tamagotchi, I'm sorry)</li>
				<li>Looks almost the same on every screen</li>
				<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem well, kind of</li>
				<li>It's accessible, so everyone can enjoy it but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</li>
				<li>Shit is even more legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an ARPANET website</li>
				<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use IPoAC</li>
				<li>Uses only free and open-source resources, like this awesome font called "Open Sans" which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</li>
				<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website <li>is proudly made with plain HTML5, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
				<li>Doesn't include any tracking service this website does, but hey, I gotta see who visits me!</li>
				<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available JUST USE IT.</li>
				<li>Use some fucking colors.</li>
				<li>Links don't really need to keep that shitty blue the browser is giving them: nor that violetish color when they are marked as visited.</li>
				<li>Just give them a nice color</li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Well guess what, motherfucker:</h2>
			<p>Black on white? How often do you see that kind of contrast in real life? Tone it down a bit, asshole. I would've even made this site's background a nice <code>#EEEEEE</code> if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.</p>

		<h2>Size Matters</h2>
			<p>This website is even better than the last guy and the guy before him.<br>Why?</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It's over a secure connection - so nobody can spy what we're serving to you (the page might be different for everyone, pshht!).</li>
				<li>It uses one of the most general gTLDs available out there: .website</li>
				<li>It uses the TLD, too: thebestmotherfucking.website, check out domainr to do something cool too.</li>
				<li>It uses the kickass Let's Encrypt CA (don't you see the gorgeous lock?)</li>
				<li>It runs on nginx: a better alternative than Apache Server honestly, this whole thing runs now behind Traefik as well, but you'll never notice it</li>
				<li>It uses a custom version of the awesome ultra-lightweight jQuery /s</li>
				<li>It probably doesn't support all the web browsers, but that's the best thing - if the user's browser is outdated he will notice and maybe he will switch from the crap he uses to a much cooler browser</li>
				<li>It uses some cool technologies like JavaScript JavaScript logo, CSS3 CSS3 logo and HTML5 HTML5 Logo</li>
				<li>Freaks who are scared of Javascript will feel safe here since the website doesn't need to have JS enable to be properly rendered</li>
				<li>It supports HTTP/2</li>
				<li>It includes a Cache-Control header, so you don't waste your precious bandwidth if you visit the website more than once</li>
				<li>It uses Matomo, a free and Open Source analytics platform (we still love you Google, don't be mad at us)</li>
				<li>It allows universal access from every website via CORS</li>
				<li>It is Accessible</li>
				<li>It's Open Source, freely available on Github, and everybody can contribute to it.</li>
				<li>It uses the WTFPL - Do What the Fuck You Want to Public License, which is pretty clear on what you can and what you can't do:</li>
				<li><code>0. You just DO WHAT THE FUCK YOU WANT TO.</code></li>
			</ul>

		<h2>Put even less contrast</h2>
			<p>Yeah, a #444 is cool but a #454545 is better.</p>
			<p>We don't need to break our eyes while looking at a <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span>.</p>

		<h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
			<p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make a text that is only readable by ants.</p>

	
		<h2>Put some pictures</h2>

	<div class="cat-block">

			<figcaption>A cat, just to keep the context of the website.</figcaption>
		</figure>

		<div>
			<p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephenie Meyer, this is a <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span>. Add some relevant pictures to give a little bit of context, or to cheer up the reader. Do you really like to waste the power of technology that we have nowadays? Come on, you're using a web browser on a computer, you're not reading a book on a Kindle.</p>
			<p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
			<p>You see the picture of this cute cate? He's happy, and you should be too.</p>

		<h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
			<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span> with shitty animations. Keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users, less requests (with a small size) = faster load time! Oh and by the way, this doesn't mean that you should use webpack and put everything in a 10MB main.js file, there are people out there who are still using 56k modems and haven't tried futuristic technologies!</p>
			<blockquote>"Good design is as little design as possible."<br>Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</blockquote>
			<p>That's not entirely true, look at that motherfuckingwebsite. It's so minimal that it seems like I'm reading the txt version of the SMTP RFC (RFC5321)</p>


		<h2>Epilogue</h2>
			<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite(.com)</span> and the bettermotherfuckingwebsite. Despite the criticism here, they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still <span class="mfw">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite</span>, so go check 'em out. Nevertheless, this shows that the internet has taken a really wrong turn - I honestly miss the time when websites were made to convey information. At least, thanks god, we got rid of pop-ups.</p>
			<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again"</p
